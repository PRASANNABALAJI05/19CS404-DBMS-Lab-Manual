# 📘 ER Diagram Workshop – Submission

## 🎯 Objective
To understand and apply **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling** concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## 📚 Purpose
This workshop provides hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent **database structure**, including:
- Entities
- Relationships
- Attributes
- Constraints

## 🏋️ Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

### 📌 Business Context
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its **members, trainers, and fitness programs**.

### ✅ Requirements
- Members register with **name, membership type, and start date**.

- Trainers are **assigned to programs**; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may **book personal training sessions** with trainers.  
- **Attendance** recorded for each session.  
- **Payments** tracked for memberships and sessions.

### 🗂 Entities and Attributes
| Entity   | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Member   | MemberID (PK), Name, MembershipType, StartDate | Registers for programs |
| Program  | ProgramID (PK), Name, Type | Yoga, Zumba, etc. |
| Trainer  | TrainerID (PK), Name, Specialization | Assigned to programs |
| Session  | SessionID (PK), Date, Time, MemberID (FK), TrainerID (FK) | Personal training |
| Payment  | PaymentID (PK), Amount, Date, MemberID (FK), Type | Membership/session |

### 🔗 Relationships and Constraints
| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Member–Program | M:N | Total | A member can join many programs |
| Program–Trainer | M:N | Partial | Trainers assigned to programs |
| Member–Trainer (Personal Session) | M:N | Partial | Booked sessions |
| Session–Attendance | 1:N | Total | Tracks presence |
| Member–Payment | 1:N | Total | Payments for membership & sessions |

### 📝 Assumptions
- Each session involves **one member and one trainer**.  
- Membership type determines validity period (not modeled in ER).  
- Payments linked either to membership or personal training.

| Loan     | LoanID (PK), LoanDate, ReturnDate, MemberID (FK), BookID (FK) | Tracks borrow |
| Event    | EventID (PK), Name, Date | Library event |
| Speaker  | SpeakerID (PK), Name, Expertise | Linked to events |
| Room     | RoomID (PK), RoomNo, Capacity | Used for events/study |
